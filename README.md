# Getting Started with Accounting Service Provider app

## Let's checkout the site first [Accounting Service Provider](https://accounting-service-provider.web.app/)

## Some key Functionalities of this app

This site is fully focused on an individual accounting service provider.

- On homepage, there is a responsive navbar, a nice banner with relevant background image, title and some introductory texts, 3 service cards, speciality section and a responsive footer.
- For services section, used a json file containing image, title, id, rate, description. On homepage there are 3 service cards but on Services page there are all the 6 service cards. For displaying these two things using a single component, used condition (props children).
- For every services, there is a button to book appointment. This button goes to an appointment booking form page which is a protected route. You must login before booking an appointment.
- For managing user registration & login, used google firebase email & password authentication, google and github sign-in authentication.
- User will receive a verification email after signing up using email & password.
- If an user forget password then can reset the password. But for this need to input the email first.
- After login, the login menu will be replaced by sign out menu.
- The whole site is device friendly.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
